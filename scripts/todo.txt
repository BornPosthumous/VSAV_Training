TODO:
The Dreaded Reversals
    - Iron out showing PB/GC/R in input display (this is easy but annoying bc of gui permutations)
    - randomized character specific reversals (e.g. i want a Soul Fist OR Shadow Blade or DI as my reversal randomly). 
    - Randomized "manual" reversal options e.g. "I want upback + button OR 5lp as a counter attack". Recording slots can already be randomized.

Menu
    - In menu general tutorial text (should be easier to digest than menu digging for descriptions)

Throws
    - Also grapple mashes

Character Selection
    - Fun but not necessary: Character pallette swaps on char select (Kyle doing this was so cool!)

Recording
    - Give recording side swap another go (**difficult**)

Distribution
    - TEST TEST TEST and send to your favorite BETA tester friends
    - Create videos for training mode usage and common training scenarios
    - Distribute :)

Guard
    - Simple adaptive guard (i.e. switch to blocking low if its a low move, probably not sooo bad because no standing lows or low hitting specials iirc)
    - Try to smooth over the blocking algo
    - chicken guard

Possible ideas (not all investigated):
- Investigate and create GUI countdowns if possible for:
  0x143   Throw Invulnerability Timer 
  0x147 	Invincibility Timer 
- Option to show the values of various block timers on screen (hit spark, push back etc)
